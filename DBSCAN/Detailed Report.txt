Answers to questions:

Question 1:

Number of clusters in Outlier dataset : 4
Number of clusters in Fullmoon dataset : 2

Outlier dataset has noise points along the y=0 straight line.
Fullmoon dataset also has a few noise points along the y=0 straight line. 

All clusters in Outlier dataset are circular. 
One cluster in Fullmoon dataset is circular like the fullmoon,
while the other cluster is like the not common space between semi-circles of varying radius. 

Prediction:
For clusters that represent a cluster K-Means clustering algorithm will not work fine. 
For the same clusters DBSCAN is expected to perform well. 

Question 2:

The implementation of K-Means clustering algorithm is in the file named kmeans.py
Number of clusters and name of dataset is given as input in the terminal.

Question 3:

The implementation of DBSCAN clustering algorithm is in the file named dbscan.py
The name of dataset, number of minimum points and epsilon threshold is given as input in the terminal.

Question 4:

(a) Dataset: fullmoon Number of clusters: 2
    The final centroids are :  [(6.033001265008878, -6.421382097868564), (-7.651206386036964, -5.793883942505131)] 
    The number of points in cluster  1 is :  563 
    The number of points in cluster  2 is :  487   
    The sum of squared error between the points and their respective centroids is :  52241.49386460261

The inability of kmeans to distinguish circular shapes is clearly seen with one half of the graph belonging to one cluster and the other half to the other cluster.

    Dataset: fullmoon Number of clusters: 3
    The final centroids are :  [(7.718661888557211, -9.01335154228856), (-9.223187738419618, -7.61742473569482), (-0.1692170000000001, -0.06369182597864777)]
    The number of points in cluster  1 is :  402
    The number of points in cluster  2 is :  367
    The number of points in cluster  3 is :  281
    The sum of squared error between the points and their respective centroids is :  31672.468724553815

The fullmoon part of the cluster forms a single cluster, the shell part of the data points seprates into two halves like before with one half belonging to one cluster. 

(b) Dataset: outlier Number of clusters: 2
    The final centroids are :  [(20.121989580838314, 2.493889664670659), (-19.63480542405063, -1.9847512911392409)]                                                              
    The number of points in cluster  1 is :  334
    The number of points in cluster  2 is :  316
    The sum of squared error between the points and their respective centroids is :  137469.1333186258

The big clusters are clearly separated, but there is a problem with the separation of some points in the small cluster which is wrongly clustered, points with x<0,y=0 belong to one cluster, points with x>0,y=0 beling to another cluster.

    Dataset: outlier Number of clusters: 4
    The final centroids are :  [(20.45921921568627, 10.178218470588234), (17.138888240000007, -11.974896133333335), (-22.29076923076924, 8.20609572027972), (-19.874431045751628, -8.155660758169933)]                                            The number of points in cluster  1 is :  204
    The number of points in cluster  2 is :  150
    The number of points in cluster  3 is :  143
    The number of points in cluster  4 is :  153
    The sum of squared error between the points and their respective centroids is :  74463.34633110547

Totally chaotic clustering. Not one of the four clusters are separated correctly.

Question 5:

(a) Datset: fullmoon , eps=1.3, MinPts=7
    The number of core points are: 1037
    The number of noise points are: 0
    The number of border points are: 13
Image of cluster formation has been attached: dbcsan_fullmoon_7_1.3
No distinction, almost all points are labelled as core points. 

    Datset: fullmoon , eps=0.9 MinPts=7
    The number of core points are: 890
    The number of noise points are: 26
    The number of border points are: 134
Image of cluster formation has been attached: dbcsan_fullmoon_7_0.9
Noise points are clearly defined, the two necessary clusters are also defined well, but the noise points along y=0 straight line form a separate cluster of it's own.

    Datset: fullmoon , eps=1.3, MinPts=15
    The number of core points are: 844
    The number of noise points are: 34
    The number of border points are: 172
Image of cluster formation has been attached: dbcsan_fullmoon_15_1.3
Proper clustering takes place with noise points, core points and boundary points clearly defined. 

(b) Datset: outlier , eps=3.2, MinPts=8
    The number of core points are: 590
    The number of noise points are: 45
    The number of border points are: 15
Image of cluster formation has been attached: dbcsan_outlier_8_3.2
Perfect clustering, the two small clusters form separate clusters, distinction of noise points and the two big clusters is also clear. 

    Datset: outlier , eps=2.5, MinPts=8
    The number of core points are: 447
    The number of noise points are: 66
    The number of border points are: 137
Image of cluster formation has been attached: dbcsan_outlier_8_2.5
The two small clusters form separate clusters, distinction of noise points is also done well but a part of the two big clusters forms a separate cluster.  

    Datset: outlier , eps=3.2, MinPts=15
    The number of core points are: 321
    The number of noise points are: 84
    The number of border points are: 245
Image of cluster formation has been attached: dbcsan_outlier_15_3.2
The two small clusters are distinguished well, multiple clusters are formed withing the big clusters which is improper, definiton of noise points is acceptable.
